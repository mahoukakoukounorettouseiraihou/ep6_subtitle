1
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,290
JANUARY 24, 2096 - USNA EMBASSY

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,870
Is that true, Silvie?

3
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,790
Yes. I've received orders
from the General Staff Office to return home.

4
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,660
But why?

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,950
Because I was not good enough to fulfill
my rear support role on this mission.

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,450
I'm terribly sorry, Commander!

7
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,540
Silvie, don't call me that! It's too stiff!

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,410
Please, call me Lina
like you have until now.

9
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,990
All right, Lina.

10
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:49,330
It hurts me to go back home and leave you
to your own oversleeping habits, but...

11
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,450
Now you're too informal!

12
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,160
Besides, the day before yesterday
was the only day I slept in, wasn't it?

13
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,160
Are you done?

14
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,080
Colonel!

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:08,410
COLONEL VIRGINIA BALANCE - FIRST DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF THE USNA JOINT
CHIEFS OF STAFF INTERNAL INSPECTION OFFICE WITHIN THE INFORMATION BUREAU

16
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,080
Major Sirius, the mission assigned to you

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,740
was not suitable given your duty

18
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,660
and your skills.

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:15,200
And it is my belief that failing in your mission
does not deserve laying the onus upon you.

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,870
Regardless, however,
of where the responsibility for this lies,

21
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,370
the fact that someone
in the position of Stars

22
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:25,160
was defeated in magical combat
is something we need to be concerned about.

23
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,580
After all, you are the
strongest magician in the military.

24
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,040
Of course, you will no doubt
want a chance to vindicate yourself.

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,620
Isn't that right, Major?

26
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,450
Of course, Colonel!

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,080
Resume your current mission, Major Sirius.

28
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,040
I will also raise our on-site support
to the highest level.

29
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,160
Show me the true power of Sirius.

30
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,370
Yes, ma'am!

31
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,640
KYUCHOJI TEMPLE

32
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,890
JANUARY 29, 2096

33
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:40,200
A means of directly attacking a parasite
drifting through the sea of information...

34
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,160
It figures that even you'd have
trouble with this.

35
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,080
It doesn't seem to me you have
absolutely no compatibility with it, though...

36
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,120
since you learned how to fire a farstrike
in the true world in three days.

37
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,950
In your case, you know
where you're supposed to aim,

38
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,040
so putting together a different attack method
instead of the farstrike would be an idea.

39
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,580
You think too highly of me.

40
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:26,410
I can't develop new spells
willy-nilly like that.

41
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,080
Is that so?

42
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,120
You're certainly incapable
in certain fields,

43
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,870
but you have extraordinary talent
in spell improvement and development.

44
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,080
That's right, Brother!

45
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,080
You can make wonderful ideas reality!

46
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,410
Ideas that other people
would never even think of!

47
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,830
Couldn't you continue your first plan
of using Program Demolition...

48
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,740
to directly attack while you move forward
with new spell development at the same time?

49
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,330
All right.

50
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,120
I'll try doing just that.

51
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,580
The magicians then went to the Dallas
National Particle Accelerator Institute

52
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,540
and forced the scientists there
to perform an experiment

53
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,410
to generate a micro black hole,
ignoring the scientists' warnings.

54
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,950
Brother...

55
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,080
"USNA ARMY SUMMONS DEMON FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION WITH MAGIC EXPERIMENT?

56
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,910
During the experiment,
a hole opened in the dimensional wall,

57
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,360
This is...

58
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,040
"USNA ARMY FAILED EXPERIMENT"

59
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,040
"IGNORED SCIENTISTS' WARNINGS,
FORCING THEM TO PERFORM AN
EXPERIMENT AT THE NATIONAL
PARTICLE ACCELERATOR INSTITUTE

60
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,040
and it called forth
a demon from another dimension.

61
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,910
The magicians tried to counter
Japan's secret weapon by using the demon.

62
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,990
But they failed to control it,
and it possessed their bodies instead.

63
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,990
That's just what Shizuku told us, isn't it?

64
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,950
Blame for the victims falls
squarely on the military.

65
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,950
Yeah, though it seems
like it's been dramatized quite a bit.

66
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:28,970
"HOLDING THE MILITARY
AND MAGICIANS ACCOUNTABLE..."

67
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,790
The underlying cause of this scandal...

68
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,660
is the military's failure to
completely regulate magicians.

69
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,120
Magic is powerful, but nobody knows when
the supernatural ability will go out of control.

70
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,330
Is using it truly within national interests?

71
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,830
Shouldn't we be carefully rethinking
our stance on the matter?

72
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,660
It's skillfully sugarcoated, but...

73
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,080
Then...

74
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,870
Yes, the expulsion of magicians
is probably their true intention.

75
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,660
Did you see the news this morning?

76
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,790
Yeah. Not that I wanted to, though.

77
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,740
How much of it is true?

78
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,990
All the important bits are downright lies!

79
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,540
They don't tell you anything
except surface-level facts!

80
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,660
So, as I thought,
they're manipulating public opinion.

81
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,330
But those things should've all
been naturally treated as confidential.

82
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,620
I wouldn't think someone on the outside
could find out about them so easily.

83
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,740
It's the Seven Sages probably.

84
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,240
Seven Sages?

85
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,370
There's this group that calls themselves that.
Nobody knows who they are, though.

86
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,950
You don't know who they are?

87
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,080
Aren't they a USNA-based organization?

88
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,740
Is that possible?

89
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,660
It is possible!
Frustrating though it may be!

90
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,240
All we have is their name
which they gave us.

91
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,410
No matter how much we investigate,
we can't come up with anything!

92
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:52,490
The only thing we know is that they call their
officers "Sages," and there are seven of them.

93
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,330
Sages... That's rather on the nose, isn't it?

94
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,040
I'm telling you, we don't know who they are!

95
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,660
Hold on, Lina.
Don't get mad at my brother for it.

96
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,700
Wha...

97
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,950
These Seven Sages...

98
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,990
Is it possible they're linked
to the humanist movement?

99
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,410
I can't deny it outright, but probably not.

100
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,040
According to our profilers,

101
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,490
their mentality is transient
and delights in committing crime.

102
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,910
I see.

103
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,410
One last thing if it's all right...

104
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,700
What?

105
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,620
Did they draw the parasite
into this world on purpose?

106
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,040
No.

107
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,200
If you were serious about that,
I'd be angry, Tatsuya.

108
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,830
I've already passed judgment
on four of the infected.

109
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,910
If you're suggesting
someone did this as part of a scheme...

110
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,080
I could never forgive them!

111
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,370
FEBRUARY 12, 2096

112
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,290
We tried investigating the Seven Sages
by various means, as well,

113
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,240
but unfortunately,
didn't come up with any notable clues.

114
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,410
There hasn't been any particular manipulating
of public opinion since then, either.

115
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,330
We'll continue investigating
on our side, too.

116
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,160
If you come across any clues, contact me.

117
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,410
Roger that.

118
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,040
Thank you for coming all the way here today.

119
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,410
Oh, right...

120
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,990
Here you are! It's two days early,
but some friendly chocolate.

121
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,330
The obligatory kind, ma'am?

122
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,830
Are you unhappy with it?

123
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,540
Not in the slightest.

124
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,580
Goodnight.

125
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,950
FEBRUARY 13, 2096

126
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,740
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen Honoka.

127
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,290
She went home early.

128
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,370
Right.

129
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,580
To get ready for tomorrow, huh?

130
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,700
Yes, no doubt.

131
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,080
She's definitely the type
to put a lot of effort into things like that.

132
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,370
Are you happy, Brother?

133
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,160
It's not that. I just feel bad.

134
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,950
I can repay any gifts,
but I can't return what really matters.

135
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,040
Please, you don't need to worry
about things like that.

136
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,370
Honoka and I want only for you to be happy
from the bottom of our hearts.

137
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,140
Really?

138
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,620
Yes.

139
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,160
All you need to do
is accept that without comment.

140
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,740
Um...

141
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,790
I don't want to be a third wheel here, but...

142
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,540
Essentially, Honoka wasn't looking well

143
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,870
because she was worried
about giving you chocolate tomorrow?

144
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,120
You did well to notice, Lina.

145
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,330
I'd thought chocolate-giving
was a custom unique to Japan.

146
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,160
That's right.

147
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,410
Valentine's Day chocolate
is a famous bit of Japanese culture.

148
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,490
To whom will you give
your chocolate, Lina?

149
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,040
Even you're asking me that, Miyuki?

150
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,060
I didn't plan on giving chocolate to anyone.

151
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,950
Oh, but not even obligatory chocolate?

152
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:52,290
If I gave individual gifts,
it would cause all sorts of problems.

153
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,410
Really? It must be difficult being so popular.

154
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,660
You're amazingly popular yourself, Miyuki.

155
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,410
Who will you give chocolate to?

156
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,580
Will Tatsuya get the real thing?

157
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,790
What are you saying, Lina?

158
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,540
My brother and I are siblings.

159
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,040
It would be strange for me
to give him homemade chocolates.

160
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,330
Hey, Izumi,
what do you think she's doing?

161
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:31,740
I think she's making
chocolates, but... Kasumi...

162
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,120
about the chocolate our sister is using...

163
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,790
Yeah.

164
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,290
It's the 95% cocoa, 0% sugar kind...

165
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,580
And that bag...

166
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,990
It's espresso powder, isn't it?

167
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,120
I wonder if something bad happened to her.

168
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,040
Good morning, Tatsuya!

169
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,290
Good morning, Honoka.

170
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,370
Good morning.

171
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,330
Good morning, Miyuki!

172
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,990
Um, Tatsuya...

173
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,410
Could I maybe take up
a bit of your time?

174
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,450
Sure.

175
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:43,450
Then, I'll go on ahead to class, Brother.

176
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,830
Good luck, Honoka.

177
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,580
U-Um, Tatchu...

178
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,080
Thank you, Honoka.

179
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,040
Um, Tatsuya, what's...

180
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,160
A little something in return.

181
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,290
It's separate from next month,
so you can expect something then, too.

182
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,370
I, um... Is this... I can't...

183
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,040
Um, Tatsuya, may I open it?

184
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,540
Of course.

185
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,620
Tatsuya, thank you!

186
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,290
I'll treasure them forever!

187
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,040
VISITOR ARC VI

188
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,910
Yo, Tatsuya!

189
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,580
You look kind of exhausted,
and the day just started.

190
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,950
And you seem good as new
even though you just got discharged.

191
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,580
What can I say?

192
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,700
Good morning.
Leo, you're back to normal, huh?

193
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,660
So, this is your first day back?

194
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,160
I'm glad you recovered
faster than we thought.

195
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,830
Yep. Thanks for coming to visit
so many times.

196
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,040
Valentine's Day chocolate.

197
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,870
They're for all you guys.

198
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,870
Thank you.

199
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,040
I appreciate it.

200
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,240
Thank you.

201
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,370
I thought you were out of the hospital early.
You were after the chocolate?

202
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,080
Of course not!

203
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,620
Oh, was I right?

204
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,120
Good morning, Erika.

205
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,620
You're late today.

206
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,200
Morning, Tatsuya.

207
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,620
February 14 is awful every year.

208
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,910
It's because we got
so many men around in our dojo.

209
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,790
That really does seem like a lot of work.

210
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,830
It is! It's so annoying!

211
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,290
Valentine's Day can go
jump off a cliff for all I care!

212
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,330
Miki, you must have it nice.

213
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,330
You've got a lot of girls
among your pupils, don't you?

214
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,490
You get your pick of the litter
every year, don't you?

215
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,790
Yoshida, is that true?

216
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,490
That's not true!

217
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,830
Anyway, if I were that frivolous,
I could never do any real training!

218
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,910
Oh no, you don't, Miki.

219
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,620
What about our dojo
are you trying to say is frivolous?

220
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,910
Uh, wait...

221
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,660
I didn't mean that...

222
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,080
Then, what in the world did you mean?

223
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,740
Oh, there he is!

224
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,620
Subaru, over here!

225
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,830
Shiba!

226
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,910
Hey, Eimi, don't run!

227
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,790
Would you be so kind
as to accept this?

228
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:01,910
Satomi... You're acting more theatrical
than usual. What's this?

229
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,370
This is a gesture of thanks from the
Nine School Competition freshman girls' team.

230
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,830
How should I say? Our gratitude...

231
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,660
Oh, it's the whole team
but not Miyuki or Honoka.

232
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,450
They most likely wish to give you
something personally.

233
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,080
If we did anything out of place,
they'd probably get mad.

234
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Thank you.

235
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,990
Not that it fully replaces them,
but this includes Shizuku's part, as well.

236
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,950
Make sure you call her
or text her later to say you received it.

237
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,950
Bye!

238
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,490
Oh, Tatsuya...
Is it your turn on patrol today?

239
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,540
Yes.

240
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,330
By the way, Tatsuya,

241
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,740
I'd like a moment of your time.

242
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,370
I don't mind, but first...

243
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,620
Shiba... Water...

244
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,450
Shiba, you have my thanks.

245
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,450
Pres... Or rather, Saegusa...

246
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,540
I'll be taking my leave now.

247
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,700
Saegusa...

248
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,200
What in the world happened to Hattori?

249
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,450
Never mind him. Here!

250
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,740
Is it... coffee?

251
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,290
No, chocolate!

252
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Well, thank you very much.

253
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,290
Go ahead, try a piece.

254
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,540
Right now?

255
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,370
Yep. I want to hear what you think of it.

256
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,040
In that case, I have something
I'd like to talk to you about...

257
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,450
so could we go somewhere else?

258
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,990
You don't want others to hear?

259
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:45,950
Yes.

260
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,160
Come with me.

261
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,080
Did you want to discuss the parasite?

262
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,620
Yes.

263
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,580
It hasn't been appearing
in the media lately.

264
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,040
Has the damage subsided?

265
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,990
On the surface, yeah.

266
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,080
But the number of missing persons this year
is high compared to other years,

267
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,910
so we should probably interpret that
as them getting more careful with their actions.

268
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,620
Maybe taking one down
put them on their guard.

269
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,240
I would imagine.

270
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,660
It could be that they possess
coperception between them.

271
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,700
Coperception?

272
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,990
It's a shortened form
of common sensual perception.

273
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,120
It's a form of ESP observed
frequently between identical twins.

274
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,040
In other words,
if one sees or hears something,

275
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,620
the entire group
shares the experience?

276
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,790
Yes, but it's nothing
more than speculation.

277
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,740
I hate not understanding anything.

278
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,330
When it comes to situations
with a lot of unknowns,

279
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,450
all we can do is hope we stumble
onto ways to deal with them.

280
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,740
What's the matter?

281
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:56,700
The fact that I had no clue what the term
"common sensual perception" meant...

282
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,990
That won't be
on the entrance exams, will it?

283
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:08,290
ESP is treated as a separate academic field
from the magic sciences, so I don't think it will.

284
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,540
That about does it.

285
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,540
Well, I'll be on my way.

286
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,660
Are you all right, Brother?

287
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,040
It's nothing major.

288
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,870
I'll carry your bag for you.

289
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,830
That's okay.

290
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,200
I insist. Come on.

291
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,450
Fine.

292
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,330
What's wrong?

293
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,540
Never mind! It's nothing.

294
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,790
I see.

295
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,540
Brother? Do you see something?

296
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,660
No.

297
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,500
What's wrong?

298
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,870
Well...

299
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,160
I believe our surveillance
may have been noticed, ma'am.

300
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,290
What? That's absurd.

301
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,490
Sure, it's low-orbit,
but it's an observation satellite monitor.

302
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:04,620
But, ma'am, I know I saw Tatsuya Shiba's eyes
look directly to here from inside the monitor.

303
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,700
Fine, then. Replay the video,
starting three minutes ago.

304
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,290
Here.

305
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,200
You're overthinking it.

306
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,700
It's better than letting your mind wander,

307
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,330
but being too cautious
is another source of mistaken judgment.

308
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,450
Yes, ma'am!

309
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,580
Brother, dinner is ready.

310
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,080
Chocolate sauce...

311
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,120
and chocolate fondue...

312
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,540
This is how she did it?

313
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,160
Brother...

314
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,080
Please feel free to eat up.

315
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,080
This is the Valentine's chocolate
that I prepared...

316
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,450
for you and you alone.

317
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,870
Your face is flushed.

318
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,580
Oh? Why, I wonder...

319
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,490
You probably didn't cook off
enough of the brandy in the fondue.

320
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,080
Go rest for a bit on the sofa.

321
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,200
I'll clean up here.

322
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,990
Okay.

323
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,080
I bungled it up at the very end.

324
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,240
Why...

325
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,540
must I be his sister?

326
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,990
I didn't have to lie about it.

327
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,040
It's just obligatory chocolate.

328
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,540
And yet, I couldn't give it to him.

329
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,620
It was as though I...

330
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,370
This has to be some sick joke!

331
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:28,330
Me, in love with that sarcastic, sister-obsessed
philanderer? I'll never allow that!

332
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,660
Welcome home, Major Sirius.

333
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,950
Colonel!

334
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,040
VISITOR ARC VII
